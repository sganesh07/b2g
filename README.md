This project "consumes" a book into a graph db for ease of search and hopefully an intuitive UI for ease of comphrehension as well. The free instance at pythonanywhere was not allowing an external connection to neo4j so while the code below shows how to connect to the aura instance (from neo4j) the hosted instance works on a free mysql server given by pythonanywhere.

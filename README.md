consuming a book into a graph db for ease of search 

This repository will contain an NLP code to cull out ailment names from the Home remedies books. Waiting on an official confirmation from the publishers before i can post those here. 

I will also post the code for interacting with Neo4j from Python - which was particularly intensive because this was my first time. The free tier at pythonanywhere forced me to temporarily host this on MS SQL so that code will also be there.

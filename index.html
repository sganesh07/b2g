  <h3> Welcome to my blog on transforming a 'book to graph':b2g</h3> 
<p> 
    The attempt to 'graph draw' a book content came from having to read the book many times over the past 2 years :) Home remedies was translated by my father few years ago in our local language - Tamil and since Covid - became a standing book of reference for all things that we could avoid visiting a Doctor. I may not have done justice to the history and the depth of information the book presents but hopefully the crux of the book on it's relevance to common ailments through easily available plants is retained here.

    What started as a means to learn NLP (nltk in python), Neo4j ended up teaching me a lot of d3js, forcelayout and of course a wonderful hosting PaaS engine in pythonanywhere. I will post the cleaned up code shortly and more importantly a NER (named entity recognition) file for ailments that should help other NLP enthusiasts. It was something i missed when i started with this program (to auto recognize diseases from the book) but then the workaround here was simple text processing.

    Right now am waiting on a request to the publisher requesting for permission to upload the other chapters so this can be an easy reckoner for everyone. Shortly i will post the code for both the neo4j version and a simpler mysql version (since pythonanywhere free tier didn't allow wiring to a neo4j aura db - the cloud hosted instance).
